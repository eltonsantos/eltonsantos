# Elton Santos 👨‍💻

### Hi there, welcome to my profile! 👋

My name is Elton Santos from Brazil (🇧🇷). I work with development since 2011 and I am currently Software Developer at [CAGECE - Companhia de Água e Esgoto do Ceará](https://www.cagece.com.br/). In addition to development, I am also an Expert in Computer Forensics na [APECOF - Associação Nacional de Peritos em computação Forense](https://www.apecof.org.br/), acting as an Ad-Hoc Expert in the area of software plagiarism, expertise in Windows and Linux operating systems and expertise in images.

In my free time I like to play video games (🎮), to watch movies (🎞️) and series (📺), to read books (📚), to listen to music (🎵) and participating in open source projects or creating something to post on my github (:octocat:).

Would you like to meet me? It's too easy!
